# Tencent SCF Build And Deploy

Tencent Cloud Function does not require WeClawBot to build packages on the
`weclawbot` server. A function can be packaged locally, in CI, on the
`weclawbot` host, or by Tencent's online dependency installer.

WeClawBot should still keep a Linux server or CI build path because WeChat
content is hard to predict. Attachment processing will eventually include
native packages, OCR tools, Office/PDF converters, and reproducible regression
tests. A Mac-only package is not a reliable production artifact.

The `weclawbot` server should be able to dynamically build and deploy SCF
variants from signed skill and extractor templates. Dynamic build means
expanding trusted runtime capabilities on demand; it does not mean deploying
arbitrary code generated from a user message.

## Policy

| Function | Build target | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text curator | Zip from local, CI, or `weclawbot` | Pure Node.js/TypeScript, small package |
| Voice transcript curator | Zip from local, CI, or `weclawbot` | Uses WeChat `voice_item.text`, no audio decoder |
| Image OCR | Linux CI or container image | OCR engines and image libraries often include native binaries |
| PDF extractor | Linux CI initially; image if native tools grow | Embedded-text extraction can be pure JS, OCR needs native tools |
| DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / CSV | Linux CI or `weclawbot`; image if conversion tools are needed | OOXML parsing can be pure JS, Office conversion is native-heavy |

The first shipping artifact should be a small zip package for the text curator.
Attachment functions can move to container image deployment only when zip +
layers become awkward.

## Repository Shape

```text
runtime/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── src/
│   ├── runtime/
│   ├── skills/
│   └── adapters/
│       ├── tencent-scf.ts
│       ├── node-host.ts
│       └── offline-eval.ts
└── scripts/
    ├── build-scf.sh
    ├── test-runtime.sh
    └── package-scf.sh
```

`package-scf.sh` should produce:

```text
dist/weclawbot-curator-scf.zip
dist/weclawbot-attachment-scf.zip
```

The zip root must contain the SCF entry file and its runtime dependencies.
Secrets are never packaged. Tencent API keys, DeepSeek keys, device-signing
secrets, and model configuration are provided as cloud-function environment
variables.

## Build Steps

The build should be reproducible:

1. Install exact dependencies from the lockfile.
2. Run unit tests and JSON schema tests.
3. Run skill regression fixtures.
4. Compile TypeScript to plain JavaScript.
5. Remove dev dependencies.
6. Create a zip with the entry file at the package root.
7. Optionally deploy with Tencent CLI or Serverless Cloud Framework.

## Online Dependency Install

Tencent SCF supports online dependency installation for Node.js, but WeClawBot
should not depend on it for production artifacts. Use it only for quick
experiments.

Reasons:

- reproducibility is weaker than lockfile-based CI packaging;
- install scripts are restricted for security;
- native dependencies are easier to debug in a controlled Linux build image;
- large attachment-processing dependencies should be tested before upload.

## Builder Role

The `weclawbot` host can be used as a lightweight builder and staging verifier:

- build zip packages from a clean checkout;
- run `offline-eval` against fixture files;
- smoke-test the HTTP handler locally;
- deploy to Tencent SCF when credentials are present.
- create versioned SCF variants for newly enabled skills or extractors.

It is not a required runtime hop. Once deployed, ESP32 devices call Tencent SCF
directly.

See [dynamic-scf-builder.md](dynamic-scf-builder.md) for the control-plane
design that creates SCF variants from trusted skill packages.

## Deployment Mode

Start with SCF code deployment for the text curator because it is tiny.

Use SCF image deployment later if attachment processing needs:

- system OCR binaries;
- LibreOffice or document conversion tools;
- larger native libraries;
- custom startup behavior;
- package sizes that make zip deployment uncomfortable.
